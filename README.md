# JSSleepDebtCalculator

If we don’t sleep enough, we accumulate sleep debt. In this project will calculate if you’re getting enough sleep each week using a sleep debt calculator.
The program will determine the actual and ideal hours of sleep for each night of the last week.
Finally, it will calculate, in hours, how far you are from your weekly sleep goal. 
This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript), has been an invaluable exercise in using functions using JavaScript.
